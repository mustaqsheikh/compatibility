ZOO compatability Element
=========================

ZOO element to show Joomla and ZOO version compatibility badges.

This project is a work in progress. The current version if a 100% functional ZOO Element.

Using the Element
-----------------

Follow these siple steps:

* Download the package to your Desktop
* Unzip on your Desktop
* FTP the resultant folder to your Joomla roots `media/zoo/elements/` directory
* Vistit your ZOO Admin and assign the element to your Apps Type and App templates layout positions.

These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:


This is a sub heading
---------------------

In first grade I learned that 5 > 3 and 2 < 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -> 2 -> 3. 9 <- 8 <- 7.

Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2

This is a sub heading
--------------------

Some people seem to like definition lists

<dl>
  <dt>Lower cost</dt>
  <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
</dl>

Playing the blame game
----------------------

If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:

> I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.

Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:

> I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
> the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
> come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...
>
> I don't want to sound like
> I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
> as I should be in coming up with one.

Table for two
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Crazy linking action
--------------------

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

  [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
