ZOO compatibility Element
=========================

ZOO element to show Joomla and ZOO version compatibility badges.

This project is a work in progress. 

The current version if a 100% functional ZOO Element. Badges available for Joomla 1.5, Joomla 2.5, Joomla 3.0, Joomla 3.1 and ZOO 3. In the future, I plan to add more extensions badges as requests come in.


Useful to Anyone:
----------------

* Using the excellent ZOO Extension to Blog about or distribute Joomla extensions, ZOO related extensions or other software in general.

Using the Element
-----------------

Follow these siple steps:

* Download the package to your Desktop
* Unzip on your Desktop
* FTP the resultant folder to your Joomla roots `media/zoo/elements/` directory
* Visit your ZOO Admin and assign the element to your Apps Type and App templates layout positions. You will find a link at the bottom of this page to the ZOO Documentation if you are new to ZOO.


Element Options
---------------

The element offers the following options ;

<dl>
  <dt>Button Styles</dt>
  <dd>You can choose to show the large or small Joomla! versions compatibility badges or pure CSS3 button badges</dd>
  <dt>Global or per Item display</dt>
  <dd>You can set global display options when you assign the element to your App Type. Using this option, the buttons will be enabled by default to all ZOO items in that particular App. Further, you have the option to set options on an individual per item basis in cases where you want to hide or show the badges depending on your needs.</dd>
